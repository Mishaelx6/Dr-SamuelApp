⚙️ Deployment (Windows + Vercel):

- Frontend builds to: client/dist
- Backend builds to: dist/index.js
- vercel.json:
  {
    "rewrites": [
      { "source": "/api/(.*)", "destination": "/api/index.js" }
    ]
  }

Notes:
- No Linux/Mac setup — only Windows.
- Frontend handles Paystack and Flipbook functionality.
- Just upload books/videos and everything else works automatically.
- No public speaking or blog — just Books, Videos, and Author Info.
